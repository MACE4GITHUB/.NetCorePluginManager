Allows plugin modules to retrieve a list of class Types that implement a specific attribute
            either at a class or method level.
            
            None of the Types returned are instantiated instances.
            
            This can only return Types that have been made available from within a plugin module that
            has been registered with AspNetCore.PluginManager.
