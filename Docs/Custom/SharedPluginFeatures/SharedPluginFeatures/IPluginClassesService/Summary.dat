IPluginClassesService is implemented by the AspNetCore.PluginManager and is available
            using DI.
            
            This interface provides a conduit for the application or other plugins to quickly 
            search all plugins for classes that implement or extend a specific class or interface.
            
            This can be particularly useful if for instance you define menu items within plugins, 
            the host can search all plugins for the menu class, and get a list of all objects, 
            instantiated or not.
            
            The plugin can then use the interfaces to dynamically create menu items.
