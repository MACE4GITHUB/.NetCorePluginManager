This interface is implemented by the Breadcrumb.Plugin and allows plugins to add dynamic plugins 
            to the list of available plugins managed.  Especially useful if you have dynamic data that can
            not use the BreadcrumbAttribute.
            
            An instance of this interface is available using the DI container.
