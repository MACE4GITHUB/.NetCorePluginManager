This interface is used when initially loading the AspNetCore.PluginManager to load 
            settings it requires.  A custom implementation can be supplied during initialisation
            of the Plugin Manager which can enable the settings to be loaded from a custom data
            source.
            
            This interface will be used to load PluginSetting and PluginSettings but may be
            extended in future versions to include other initialisation data.
