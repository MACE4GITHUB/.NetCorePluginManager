Provides initialisation events that can be used by plugins to affect the configuration
            of services and the application.
            
            This interface is designed to give pre and post notifications, each plugin module that 
            implements IPlugin will automatically receive the events as part of initialisation.
            
            This is particularly useful should a plugin module wish to register an interface for 
            example that is required when another plugin module is being configured or to provide
            a default implementation of an interface should no plugin have registered one whilst 
            being configured.
