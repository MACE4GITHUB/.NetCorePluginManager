This interface can be used by all plugin modules to load setting and configuration data.
            
            The default implementation which is loaded if no other plugin registers an instance uses 
            appsettings.json to store configuration data to be used by Plugins.
            
            An instance of this interface is available via the DI container, any custom implementations
            must be configured to be used in the DI contaner when being initialised.
