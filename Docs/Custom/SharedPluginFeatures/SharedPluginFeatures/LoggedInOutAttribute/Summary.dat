This attribute is used in conjunction with the UserSessionMiddleware.Plugin module and indicates that a user can be
            either logged in or out when attempting to navigate to the route.
            
            This attribute would be used if a LoggedInAttribute or LoggedOutAttribute is defined on the controller, but a specific
            method is allowed regardless of the user logged in stats.
