Provides an interface for saving UserSession data.
            
            This interface needs to be implemented by the host application which can control how the 
            session data is stored for the application.  The implementation must be registered as a service available
            usind IoC through the default DI container.
            
            Session data is managed by it's own thread and all implementation of this method must be thread safe.
            
            By using a seperate thread the current pipeline requests are not delayed waiting for data to be saved.
            
            When implementing these methods, the hosting class must update the SaveStatus property for the 
            session and page data.
