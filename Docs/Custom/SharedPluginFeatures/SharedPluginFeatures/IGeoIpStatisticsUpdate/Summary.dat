This interface is implemented internally by the GeoIpPlugin module and is not available 
            via DI or any other method.  Instead it is used to provide information on hown many GeoIp
            records were loaded and how long it took.
            
            See IGeoIpStatistics for information on retrieving statistics.
            
            This method is deprecated and should not be used by new modules as it will be removed in future versions.
